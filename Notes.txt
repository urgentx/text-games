12.10 -  I believe the game would be very difficult to design while maintaining the disconnect between 
	resources and the engine. The structure will be changed so that now each room has its own class
	derived from the Room superclass. This will enable implementing unique logic in each class (this
	would have been hard to do when reading from a separate resource file).
