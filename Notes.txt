12.10 -  I believe the game would be very difficult to design while maintaining the modularity between 
	resources and the engine. The structure will be changed so that now each room has its own class
	derived from the Room superclass. This will enable implementing unique logic in each class (this
	would have been hard to do when reading from a separate resource file).

20.10 -  The World object is a construct used to pass information about world state to rooms. It includes
	the current player object as well as a hashtable with references to all initialised rooms. 





**Storyline ideas:**

If you hit on the gril in the corridor, you need to give her a pill of this stuff that's sought after. Afte that she yields 
some useful info or item.
